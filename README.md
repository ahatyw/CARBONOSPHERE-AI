# CARBONOSPHERE.AI

**CARBONOSPHERE.AI** is an AI-driven digital twin platform designed to **simulate, visualize, and analyze global carbon fluxes** in oceans and forests. This project integrates **real-world datasets**, **multi-GHG layers**, **reinforcement learning**, and **3D interactive dashboards** to provide a comprehensive understanding of carbon dynamics and environmental impact.

## 🌍 Project Overview

CARBONOSPHERE.AI addresses the urgent need for **real-time environmental monitoring and carbon management**. Current methods of assessing carbon flux are often delayed, static, or fragmented. Our platform solves this by:

- Using **ERA5 NetCDF real ocean data** for accurate ocean carbon flux.
- Simulating **forest carbon sequestration** with dynamic animations.
- Incorporating **CH₄ and N₂O multi-greenhouse gas layers**.
- Implementing **PPO reinforcement learning agents** to optimize carbon management strategies.
- Providing **3D visualizations and interactive dashboards** for easy exploration.

The platform helps researchers, policymakers, and students visualize carbon flows and make data-driven decisions for environmental conservation.
